         * you are required to implement a set of APIs for a video-sharing platform. Your task is to develop the following APIs:
         *
         * Save Video Details API:
         *
         * Create an API endpoint that allows users to upload a video. This API should handle parameters such as video title, description, and the video url.
         * Ensure that the video url is correct, and the associated metadata is correctly maintained.
         *
         * Fetch Video Details API:
         *
         * Develop an API endpoint to fetch details of a specific video. This should include the video file, title, description, upload date, and the current view count.
         * Watch Video API:
         *  -> Params: uploaderId, Title of the video
         *
         * Implement an API to simulate watching a video.
         * This API should increase the view count for the specified video each time it is called.
         *   
         *
         * Requirements:
         *
         * Define the necessary request methods (GET, POST, etc.) and parameters for each API.
         *
         * Ensure that your APIs handle edge cases and errors gracefully.
         * @param args
